This is my **Phase 0 Project 2** as part of the Top 2% AI Engineer journey.  
The goal of this project was to practice **Python fundamentals**, understand **data structures**, and implement **CRUD operations** without using a database or any external framework.

The project focuses on:

- Storing data in **JSON files**
- Working with **lists of dictionaries**
- Implementing **Create, Read, Update, Delete** functionality
- Debugging logical errors and improving program flow
